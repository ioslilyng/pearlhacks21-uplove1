# pearlhacks21-uplove1

This is the reposotory containing the code for our submission for pearl hacks 2021.
## Inspiration
Self-care is crucial for our well-being. But, what is self-care? It may be little things we enjoy doing and refueling our energy: simply writing down thoughts and feelings, reading a book, or meditation.
## What it does
- Keep our mind away from unwanted thoughts, stress, distractions. 
- It also rewards you points for every self-care act you do. 
- A diary/journal for typing your thoughts and just letting it out.
- Recommends workouts, motivational content and books to keep your mind clear.
## How we built it
The web application runs in bootstrap using HTML, CSS, and JS
## Challenges we ran into
Each collaborator code separately. We have troubles when merging our codes together.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are able to create web pages.
- Deployed and hosting the project on netlify.
## What we learned
Bootstrap, Web development, project management, team work
## What's next for Up Love
Functionality, features, backend, maybe turn it into a social media app for users to share stories with each other
